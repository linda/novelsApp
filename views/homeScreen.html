    <p>Welcome!</p>
    <p>
        This site aims to collect the historical novels of Alexandre Dumas (p√®re), and make them easily searchable by the real historical characters that appear in them.</p>
    <p>
        This was brought up by the realisation of how often characters from the more well known novels appear in the lesser known works, and are often shown in a somewhat different light; for instances, the Richelieu who appears in Le Comte de Moret reads a bit like a take-down of the very portrayal that Dumas made particularly popular to this day with The Three Musketeers.

        While the Dumas novels are my starting point, other historical fiction will later be added as well. My main source for the entered data is the site <a href="http://dumaspere.com/">dumaspere.com</a>
